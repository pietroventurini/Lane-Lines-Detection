# Lane Lines Detection
This is a project for the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013) which consists in building a pipeline to detect lane lines in a video shoot from a moving vehicle.

## The project
The full description of the project can be found in the IPython notebooks:
- **[Base lane lines detection](https://github.com/pietroventurini/lane-lines-detection/blob/master/Base_lane_lines_detection.ipynb)** (Edge detection, hough transform)
- **[Advanced lane lines detection](https://github.com/pietroventurini/lane-lines-detection/blob/master/Advanced_lane_lines_detection.ipynb)** (Camera calibration, distortion correction, perspective transformations)
